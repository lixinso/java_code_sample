# Spring framework

The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platforms.

A key element of Spring is infrastructual support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.
